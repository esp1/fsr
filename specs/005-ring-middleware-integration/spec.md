**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Ring Middleware Integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Ring middleware integration functionality specification
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: middleware wrapping, request/response handling, Ring compatibility, handler delegation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects well-defined in existing implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Ring app ‚Üí FSR middleware ‚Üí route resolution ‚Üí response
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement based on existing behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (middleware, Ring apps, request/response maps)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec documents existing proven functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a web developer using Ring-based applications, I need to integrate filesystem routing as standard Ring middleware, so that I can add filesystem-based routing to my existing Ring application stack without changing my application architecture or breaking compatibility with other Ring middleware.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an existing Ring application with other middleware, **When** I add FSR middleware to the stack, **Then** it should integrate seamlessly without affecting other middleware functionality
2. **Given** a Ring request that matches a filesystem route, **When** the FSR middleware processes it, **Then** it should invoke the appropriate handler and return a proper Ring response
3. **Given** a Ring request that doesn't match any filesystem route, **When** the FSR middleware processes it, **Then** it should pass the request through to the next middleware in the chain
4. **Given** handler functions that return different response types, **When** processed by FSR middleware, **Then** string responses should be converted to Ring response maps with appropriate status and headers
5. **Given** handler functions that return nil, **When** processed by FSR middleware, **Then** the response should be converted to a proper HTTP 204 No Content Ring response
6. **Given** handler functions that return full Ring response maps, **When** processed by FSR middleware, **Then** those responses should be passed through unchanged

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a handler function throws an exception during request processing?
- How does the middleware handle malformed or invalid Ring request maps?
- What occurs when the filesystem root path is invalid or inaccessible?
- How are response headers and status codes preserved when converting from string responses?
- What happens when multiple FSR middleware instances are added to the same Ring stack?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Ring-compatible middleware function that can be integrated into any Ring application stack
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a filesystem root path configuration parameter when creating the middleware
- **FR-003**: System MUST process incoming Ring request maps and attempt to resolve them using filesystem routing
- **FR-004**: System MUST pass unmatched requests through to the next handler in the Ring middleware chain
- **FR-005**: System MUST convert string handler responses to Ring response maps with HTTP 200 status and appropriate Content-Type headers
- **FR-006**: System MUST convert nil handler responses to Ring response maps with HTTP 204 No Content status
- **FR-007**: System MUST pass through Ring response maps returned by handlers without modification
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all standard Ring request map keys and values when passing requests to handlers
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle middleware configuration errors gracefully without breaking the Ring application
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain Ring middleware contract for proper composition with other middleware

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Ring Application**: A web application built using the Ring HTTP abstraction with a middleware stack
- **FSR Middleware**: The middleware function that adds filesystem routing capability to Ring applications
- **Ring Request Map**: Standard Ring request format containing URI, method, headers, and other HTTP request data
- **Ring Response Map**: Standard Ring response format containing status, headers, and body
- **Middleware Chain**: The sequence of Ring middleware functions that process requests and responses
- **Handler Delegation**: The process of passing unmatched requests to the next middleware in the chain
- **Response Conversion**: The transformation of handler return values into proper Ring response formats
