**Feature Branch**: `006-create-a-route`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create a route caching system as described in @plan/improvement-plan.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What strategy should the cache use when memory limits are approached? ‚Üí A: LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction - removes oldest accessed entries
- Q: What cache metrics should the system expose? ‚Üí A: Basic metrics only - hit rate and cache size
- Q: What constitutes reasonable memory usage for the route cache? ‚Üí A: Configurable limit - allow users to set memory/entry limits with default limit of 1000
- Q: What granularity should cache invalidation support? ‚Üí A: Pattern-based invalidation - clear cache entries matching URI patterns
- Q: How should the system handle multiple concurrent requests for the same uncached route? ‚Üí A: Duplicate resolution - allow multiple requests to resolve independently

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a web application using the FSR routing system, I need route resolution to be fast and efficient so that my users experience minimal latency when accessing frequently visited pages. The system should cache resolved routes in memory to avoid repeated file system operations while maintaining the ability to clear the cache when needed for development or updates.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a web request for a URI that has been previously resolved, **When** the same URI is requested again, **Then** the route resolution should return the cached result without performing file system operations
2. **Given** a fresh application start with empty cache, **When** a URI is requested for the first time, **Then** the system should resolve the route via file system, cache the result, and return the endpoint
3. **Given** a cached route exists, **When** the cache is explicitly cleared, **Then** subsequent requests should perform fresh file system resolution and re-cache the results
4. **Given** multiple concurrent requests for the same uncached URI, **When** all requests arrive simultaneously, **Then** the system should allow independent resolution without coordination overhead
5. **Given** the system is running in development mode, **When** route files are modified, **Then** developers should have a way to invalidate cached routes to see their changes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the cache grows very large and consumes excessive memory?
- How does the system handle cache invalidation for specific routes vs. full cache clearing?
- What occurs if a cached route points to a file that has been deleted or moved?
- How does the system behave when file system permissions change for cached routes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST cache resolved route mappings in memory to avoid repeated file system operations
- **FR-002**: System MUST return cached route results for previously resolved URIs without file system access
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a mechanism to clear the entire route cache on demand
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow multiple concurrent requests to resolve the same uncached route independently
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain cache consistency by using a combination of URI and root filesystem path as the cache key
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide pattern-based cache invalidation capabilities for development workflows
- **FR-007**: System MUST fall back to normal route resolution when cache entries are missing or invalid
- **FR-008**: Cache operations MUST be thread-safe for concurrent web request processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide basic cache performance metrics including hit rate and cache size
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement configurable entry limits with LRU eviction policy (default maximum 1000 entries)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Cached route resolution MUST be significantly faster than file system resolution
- **NFR-002**: Cache lookup operations MUST have O(1) time complexity
- **NFR-003**: Memory usage MUST be bounded by configurable entry limits with default maximum of 1000 cached entries
- **NFR-004**: Cache implementation MUST not introduce memory leaks during long-running applications

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Route Cache Entry**: Represents a cached mapping containing the resolved file path and extracted parameters for a specific URI and root path combination
- **Cache Key**: Composite identifier consisting of the request URI and the root filesystem path used to uniquely identify cached routes
- **Cache Store**: In-memory data structure that maintains the collection of cached route entries with thread-safe access patterns
