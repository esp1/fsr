# Feature Specification: Core URI to File Route Resolution System

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-uri-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Core URI to File Route Resolution System"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Existing core functionality specification
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: HTTP requests, filesystem mapping, namespace resolution, handler invocation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects well-defined in existing implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: HTTP request ‚Üí file resolution ‚Üí handler execution
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement based on existing behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (filesystem paths, namespaces, handlers)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec documents existing proven functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a web application developer, I need the system to automatically route incoming HTTP requests to appropriate handler functions based on the request URI, so that I can organize my application logic using a filesystem-based approach that mirrors my website structure.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a web request to `/products`, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it should locate and execute the handler function from either `products.clj` or `products/index.clj`
2. **Given** a web request to `/user/123/profile` and a route file `user/<id>/profile.clj`, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it should match the path parameter pattern and extract "123" as the `id` parameter
3. **Given** a web request to `/category/tech/article/my-post/comments` and a route file `category/<category>/article/<<title>>.clj`, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it should extract "tech" as `category` and "my-post/comments" as `title` including the slash
4. **Given** a web request to `/blog/2024/my-post`, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it should convert the URI to the correct namespace format and invoke the appropriate handler
5. **Given** route files with single angle bracket parameters `<param>`, **When** a URI contains slashes in that segment, **Then** the system should not match that route pattern
6. **Given** route files with double angle bracket parameters `<<param>>`, **When** a URI contains any characters including slashes, **Then** the system should match and extract the entire remaining path as the parameter value
7. **Given** a web request with no matching route file, **When** the system processes the request, **Then** it should gracefully handle the missing route case

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple route files could match the same URI pattern?
- How does the system handle URIs with special characters or encoding?
- What occurs when a route file exists but has no handler function for the HTTP method?
- How are namespace naming conflicts resolved between filesystem paths and Clojure namespace requirements?
- What happens when a URI matches both a `<param>` route and a `<<param>>` route?
- How does the system handle empty path parameter values (e.g., `/user//profile`)?
- What occurs when a double angle bracket parameter `<<param>>` appears in the middle of a route pattern rather than at the end?
- How are path parameter names validated when converting to namespace symbols?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST map incoming HTTP request URIs to corresponding Clojure namespace files within a configured root filesystem path
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both direct file matching (URI `/foo` ‚Üí `foo.clj`) and index file matching (URI `/foo` ‚Üí `foo/index.clj`)
- **FR-003**: System MUST correctly convert between URI segments and Clojure namespace naming conventions (dashes to underscores for filenames)
- **FR-004**: System MUST extract path parameters from URIs using single angle brackets `<param>` for values that do not contain forward slashes
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract path parameters from URIs using double angle brackets `<<param>>` for values that may contain any characters including forward slashes
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide extracted path parameters to handler functions in the request map under `:endpoint/path-params` as a map of string parameter names to string values
- **FR-007**: System MUST convert angle bracket parameter notation in filesystem paths to valid Clojure namespace segment names
- **FR-008**: System MUST only match double angle bracket parameters `<<param>>` when they appear at the end of the route pattern
- **FR-009**: System MUST resolve handler functions using namespace metadata `:endpoint/http` mapping HTTP methods to function symbols
- **FR-010**: System MUST support template delegation via `:endpoint/type` metadata when direct handlers are not available
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle handler function responses of type string, Ring response map, or nil with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide the matched namespace symbol to handlers in the request map under `:endpoint/ns`

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **HTTP Request**: Incoming web request with URI, method, and other Ring request attributes
- **Route File**: Clojure namespace file containing handler functions and metadata within the configured filesystem path
- **Path Parameters**: Dynamic segments of URIs that are extracted and passed to handlers as named values
- **Handler Function**: Clojure function that processes requests and returns responses, identified via namespace metadata
- **Namespace Metadata**: Clojure namespace annotations that specify HTTP method to handler function mappings
- **Ring Response**: Standard Ring response format (status, headers, body) or simplified string/nil responses
