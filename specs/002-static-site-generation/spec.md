# Feature Specification: Static Site Generation System

**Feature Branch**: `002-static-site-generation`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Static Site Generation System"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Static site generation functionality specification
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: route discovery, static file generation, URI tracking, output publishing
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects well-defined in existing implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: route scanning ‚Üí handler invocation ‚Üí file output
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement based on existing behavior
6. Identify Key Entities (routes, static files, URIs, output directory)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec documents existing proven functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a web developer, I need to generate a complete static website from my dynamic route handlers, so that I can deploy my content to static hosting services while maintaining the development benefits of the filesystem router approach.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a filesystem router application with GET endpoints, **When** I run static site generation, **Then** the system should discover all routes and generate corresponding static HTML files
2. **Given** routes with dynamic path parameters, **When** I have tracked specific URIs during development, **Then** the system should generate static files for those tracked parameter combinations
3. **Given** a configured output directory, **When** static generation completes, **Then** all generated files should be organized in a directory structure that mirrors the original URI structure
4. **Given** route handlers that return different response types, **When** generating static content, **Then** the system should handle string responses, Ring response maps, and nil responses appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a route handler throws an exception during static generation?
- How does the system handle routes that depend on request-specific data (cookies, headers)?
- What occurs when the output directory already contains files?
- How are binary or non-HTML responses handled in static generation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically discover all GET endpoint functions within the configured filesystem router path
- **FR-002**: System MUST invoke each discovered endpoint function with the corresponding URI to generate static content
- **FR-003**: System MUST skip routes that contain path parameters unless those specific URIs have been explicitly tracked
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a URI tracking mechanism that allows developers to register dynamic URIs for static generation
- **FR-005**: System MUST write generated content to files in the specified output directory with appropriate file extensions
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize output files in a directory structure that matches the original URI paths
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle different response types (strings, Ring responses, nil) and convert them to appropriate static file content
- **FR-008**: System MUST process all tracked dynamic URIs in addition to parameter-free routes
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a simple API for triggering static site generation with source and destination paths
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure generated static files can be served by standard web servers without additional processing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Static Route**: A GET endpoint function that can be converted to a static file without requiring dynamic request data
- **Tracked URI**: A dynamically generated URI with path parameters that has been explicitly marked for static generation
- **Output Directory**: The filesystem location where generated static files are written
- **Static Content**: The final HTML or other content generated by invoking route handlers for static hosting
- **URI Tracker**: The mechanism that records dynamic URIs during application execution for later static generation
- **Generation Session**: A complete run of the static site generation process from route discovery to file output
